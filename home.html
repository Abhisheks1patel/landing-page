    <h3>what is a novel ?</h3>

    <p>A novel is a narrative work of prose fiction that tells a story about specific human experiences over a
        considerable length.

        Prose style and length, as well as fictional or semi-fictional subject matter, are the most clearly defining
        characteristics of a novel. Unlike works of epic poetry, it tells its story using prose rather than verse;
        unlike short stories, it tells a lengthy narrative rather than a brief selection. There are, however, other
        characteristic elements that set the novel apart as a particular literary form.</p>
